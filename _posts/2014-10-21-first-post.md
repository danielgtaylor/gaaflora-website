This is a test post and thoughtfully the first post for Gaaflora.com blog. I am an independent freelance photographer running a small business in light of photography needs within my community. I am a part time student at The Art Institute of Seattle, and a full time stay at home mum for two kiddos. 

I like to divide my time up between the endeavors I take on like being a mum, wife, business owner/entreprenuer, studentand adventurer. I often bite off more than I can chew and when I do come to this awareness I fall back on my supportive husband who has never failed to be there for me- and has also never failed to bluntly (slightly hurtfully) and repeatedly point out my flaws. We're like a well-oiled machine. 

Because I am in school, my knowledge of various genres of photography is constantly evoloving and becoming more fine-tuned. I would like to control my focus as my career developes however, to Editorial and Music Photography. 
I currently hold press credentials for many clubs in the Seattle area including Showbox, Marymoor Park, and The Paramount.

While in school, my goal is to evolve my contacts within the music industry and create a home for myself within one of the local music/events publications.
